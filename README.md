# Minimal To Do App ✔️

> As I'm learning Vue.js I've built a simple/minimal to do app using Vue.js and Tailwind.css.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
